# Documentation

## Knowledge Base Dependencies

If you need the knowledge base features, install the optional dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements-kb.txt
```

## Preparing Documents

Before building the knowledge base, place your CV at:

```
backend/portfolio_backend/media/comms/master-cv.pdf
```

The repository includes a small placeholder file in that location as a guide. Replace it with your actual `master-cv.pdf` before running the build script.
