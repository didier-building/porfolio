# Backend

## Background tasks

Celery is configured with Redis as the message broker.  Background
jobs (for example, sending contact form emails) are dispatched via
`celery` and can be processed with:

```
celery -A portfolio_backend worker -l info
```

Set `CELERY_BROKER_URL` to point at your Redis instance if different
from the default `redis://localhost:6379/0`.

## Deprecated features

Previous releases included experimental knowledgeâ€‘base and local LLM
endpoints. These components have been removed along with their heavy
ML dependencies. The backend now focuses solely on core portfolio
functionality.
